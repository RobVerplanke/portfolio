## About Me

I’m a self-taught web developer based in Groningen, the Netherlands. I’ve been actively learning web development for the past two years, primarily through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a well-respected open-source curriculum for web development.

I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and creating efficient, user-friendly web applications. As I continue to build my skills, I keep on learning and apply new technologies and improve my code quality.

## Future Goals

My goal is to become a Junior Web Developer, and this portfolio is a reflection of my growth as an aspiring web developer.
This portfolio will be continuously updated as I complete new projects and learn new technologies. Some of the next steps include:

- Exploring **Node.js**
- Building RESTful APIs with **Express**.
- Applying more advanced **TypeScript** patterns.
- Learning about state management with **Redux** or similar tools.
- Enhancing projects with testing using **Jest** or **Vitest**.
- Integrating backend and frontend for full-stack applications.
