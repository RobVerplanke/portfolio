        <h2>Who am i</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am 42 years old and live in Groningen, where I completed an MBO in
          Technical Informatics, followed by an HBO study in Communication &
          Multimedia Design. During my internships at various web design
          companies, I gained experience in developing and maintaining websites
          in a professional setting.
          <br />
          <br />
          After my studies, I didn’t immediately find a position that aligned
          with my ambitions, leading me to work in a different field. After
          several years in call centers, I realized that these roles ultimately
          offered me too little challenge. Following a period of reflection,
          orientation and consideration, I reached a point where I understood it
          was time to make a definitive career choice and invest in a field that
          truly brings fulfillment: technology and programming.
          <br />
          <br />
          The possibilities within modern web development, such as working with
          frameworks and new tools, fuled my passion. This discovery brought new
          energy and reinforced my ambition to build a career in this area. I
          then decided to deepen my knowledge through self-study in web
          development.
          <br />
          <br />
          What appeals to me in web development is the combination of analytical
          thinking and creating user-friendly solutions. Recognizing that
          structured work is essential challenges me to design a well-founded
          approach for each project and work with precision. When the final
          result sometimes exceeds expectations, it brings me immense
          satisfaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Future goals and development</h4>I have built a solid foundation
          in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React and am continuously
          working to enhance these and other skills. I am seeking opportunities
          to contribute to web applications where I can apply my knowledge and
          add value. For now, my focus is on front-end development, but I also
          have the ambition to explore back-end development.
          <br />
          <br />
          With my structured work ethic and passion for technology, I can
          contribute to a positive and productive work environment where we work
          together to build high-quality applications.
          <br />
