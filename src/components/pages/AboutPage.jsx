        <h2>Who am i</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am 42 years old and currently live in Groningen, the Netherlands,
          where I completed an MBO in Technical Computer Science and followed an
          HBO study in Communication & Multimedia Design. During internships at
          various web design companies, I gained valuable experience working on
          and building websites for clients.
          <br />
          <br />
          After my studies, I did not immediately find a position that matched
          my ambitions, which is why I eventually started working in a different
          direction. After working in various call centers for a number of
          years, I found that these positions offered me too little challenge
          and I had to take a new path.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>What inspires me</h4>
          Technology and programming have always appealed to me. After a lot of
          orientation, I discovered that web development nowadays makes
          extensive use of modern technologies, build tools and frameworks. This
          was new to me and fascinated me immediately. This gave me energy and a
          lot of motivation to follow a self-study and dive into the field of
          web development again.
          <br />
          <br />
          What I love about web development is the combination of structural,
          analytical thinking and creating a positive user experience. Knowing
          that my work is practical and valuable to users keeps me motivated to
          grow and improve
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>My goal</h4>I have a solid foundation of fluency in HTML, CSS,
          Javascript, Typescript and React and am constantly working on
          improving these and other skills. I look for opportunities to work on
          web applications where I can apply my knowledge and add value. My
          focus is currently on front-end development, but I have ambitions to
          explore other areas such as back-end development and server-side
          rendering.
