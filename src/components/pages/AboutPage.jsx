        <h2>Who am i</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I’m 42 and currently living in Groningen, the Netherlands. I completed
          an MBO in Technical Informatics and pursued HBO studies in
          Communication & Multimedia Design. During internships at various web
          design companies, I gained valuable experience working on and building
          websites for clients.
          <br />
          <br />
          After stepping away from web development for a long while, I decided
          to dive back in and retrain myself, focusing on new technologies like
          build tools and frameworks, which I find fascinating.
          <br />
          <br />
          What attracts me to web development is the challenge of
          problem-solving and the constant opportunity to learn how to code
          better and adapt to new techniques. I’ve built a solid foundation in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I’m continually working to
          improve those and other skills through self-study. For now, my focus
          is on becoming proficient in front-end development before exploring
          other areas.
          <br />
          <br />I enjoy learning and have realized how important it is for me to
          keep developing in my work, so I actively seek opportunities to grow
          and evolve. Ultimately, my goal is to turn web development into my
          full-time profession.
