        <h2>Who am i</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently living in Groningen, where I completed a MBO level 4 qualification in Technical Informatics. After that, I pursued an HBO degree in Communication & Multimedia Design at various universities of applied sciences. During internships at multiple multimedia companies, I gained experience developing and maintaining websites in a professional work environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Besides working on web applications, I like to stay fit by regularly going to the gym, and occasionally I pick up the guitar to learn to play music.
        </p>

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
          After working in call centers for several years, I realized this work did not offer me sufficient challenge. After a period of reorientation, I realized I wanted to fully focus on a field I had always been interested in: web development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Therefore, I decided to start <nbsp></nbsp>

              The Odin Project
          </a>
          </u>
          <nbsp></nbsp> in 2022, an online learning platform for web development. This gave me greater insight into building modern web applications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          What appeals to me about web development is the combination of analytical thinking and creating user-friendly solutions. Each completed project confirms for me the importance of structured work and challenges me to approach future projects even more thoughtfully and prepare even better.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h4>Development and future goals</h4>
        <p>
          I have built a solid foundation in HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. Additionally, I have become acquainted with Vue, Laravel, Tailwind CSS, and Sass. I am actively working on further developing these and other skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With my structured approach and passion for technology, I can contribute to a positive and productive work environment, where we build high-quality applications together.
