        <h2>Who am i</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently, I live in Groningen, where I completed an MBO in Technical
          Informatics. I then pursued an HBO degree in Communication &
          Multimedia Design. During internships at various web design companies,
          I gained experience in developing and maintaining websites in a
          professional setting
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to working on web applications, I enjoy staying fit by
          going to the gym regularly. I also like picking up the guitar and
          making music from time to time. I&apos;ve noticed that these hobbies
          often give me a fresh perspective on the web development projects
          I&apos;m working on and help spark new ideas or better solutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my spare time, I also like to keep up with the latest developments
          in the tech world. This helps me stay up-to-date with new knowledge
          and gives me ideas for future projects
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
          After working in call centers for several years, I realized that these
          roles ultimately didn&apos;t provide enough challenge. After a period
          of exploration, I understood that I needed to invest in a field that
          would truly give me fulfillment: technology and programming.
          <br />
          The possibilities within modern web development, such as working with
          frameworks and new tools, refuled my passion. This discovery brought
          new energy and strengthened my ambition to continue my career in this
          field. I decided to deepen my knowledge through self-study in web
          development.
          <br />
          <br />
          What excites to me about web development is the combination of
          analytical thinking and creating user-friendly solutions. With each
          project completed, I increasingly realize the importance of structured
          work. This challenges me to develop a well-thought-out approach for
          every task and to work with precision. My goal is always to exceed (my
          own) expectations, which gives me great satisfaction and drives me to
          keep challenging myself.
          <br />

        <h4>Future goals and development</h4>
        <p>
          I have built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript,
          and React, and I actively work on developing these and other skills.
          In my recent projects, I&apos;ve gained deeper insights into state
          management, routing, and using reducers. For my latest projects, I
          took it a step further by diving into TypeScript and Tailwind CSS,
          which I then applied directly.
          <br />
          <br />
          With my structured work ethic and passion for technology, I can
          contribute to a positive and productive work environment where we work
          together to build high-quality applications.
