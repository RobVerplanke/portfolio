        <h2>Who am i</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently, I live in Groningen, where I completed an MBO(4) education
          in Technical Informatics.
          <br />I then pursued an HBO degree in Communication & Multimedia
          Design.
          <br />
          During internships at various web design companies, I gained
          experience in developing and maintaining websites in a professional
          setting.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to working on web applications, I enjoy staying fit by
          going to the gym regularly.
          <br />I also enjoy picking up the guitar and learning to play music
          from time to time.
          <br />
          These hobbies often give me a fresh perspective on the projects
          I&apos;m working on and help me getting new ideas or better solutions.
          <br />

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
          After working in call centers for several years, I realized that these
          roles didn’t challenge me enough.
          <br />
          After a period of exploration, I understood that I needed to focus on
          a field that I’ve always loved and that gives me challenges and
          fulfillment: web development.
          <br />
          <br />I decided to start following{' '}
          <u>
            <a
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="http://www.theodinproject.com"
            >
              The Odin Project
            </a>
          </u>
          , an online learning platform for web development.
          <br />
          It gave me a deeper understanding of how to build projects with HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and various modern tools and frameworks.
          <br />
          <br />
          What excites me about web development is the combination of analytical
          thinking and creating user-friendly solutions.
          <br />
          With each project I complete, I realize the importance of structured
          planning and work.
          <br />
          This challenges me to develop a well-thought-out approach for every
          new project and to work with precision.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h4>Future goals and development</h4>
        <p>
          I have built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript,
          and React.
          <br />I learned the basics of Vue, Node.js and I actively work on
          developing these and other skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my recent projects, I&apos;ve gained deeper insights into
          Redux-Toolkit state management, set up back-end API endpoints and used
          Sass for styling.
          <br />
          <br />
          With my structured mindset and passion for technology, I can
          contribute to a positive and productive work environment where we work
          together to build high-quality applications.
          <br />

          potential collaborations!
